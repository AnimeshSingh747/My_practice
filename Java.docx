.java file -> .class file (bytecode) DONE BY JRE -> Machine code (binary code 0,1) DONE BY JVM

> JDK (JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT)
  > JRE (JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT)
    > JVM (JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE)
      > JIT (JUST IN TIME) JIt runs when the java programe is interpreted 
                           and its objective is to optimise the java program 
                           and make it efficient in terms of performance.


Difference BETWEEN THESE :-
                           Compiler - The compiler converts source code into machine code 
                           directly results in faster performance but very complex debugging.

                           Interpretor - The interpretor converts the whole code into machine 
                           code by executing line by line results in slower performance but easy debugging.
